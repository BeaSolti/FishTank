# FishTank
This is my "fish tank", here I would like to write about how I started to work on the project.

First I checked GitHub. I wasn't familiar with this site, so I tried to find more details on how to use it and share my ideas with others. Once I got a little bit more familiar with repository, branch, and commits which is tha same as saved changes, I tried to find more details on how to start to write the code for the project.

I had to refresh my knowledge with Java programming, I haven't used it for a while. Altough I ran into some obsticles figuring out how to correctly make the ArrayList with the three fishes, but once it was ready, it seemed easier than I first thought.

I used IntelliJ IDEA on my laptop to write and test the program.
