# FishTank
This is my "fish tank", here I would like to write about how I started to my project.

First I checked GitHub. I wasn't familiar with this site, so I tried to find more details on how to use it and share my ideas with others. Once I got a little bit more familiar with repository, branch, and commits which is tha same as saved changes, I tried to find more details on how to start to write the code for the project.
